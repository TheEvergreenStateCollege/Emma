# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Students taking DSA this quarter are on two tracks, which run parallel with frequent
interaction via pair programming and mentorship.

* First-time DSA students will be responsible for completing
* Returning DSA students will be responsible for setting their own learning curriculum.

## Choice of Programming Language

All students can choose which programming language to use to complete this quarter.
The teaching staff can provide full support for Java, building on students' experience from Computer Science Foundations.

However, learning is an adventure, and there are a diverse array of programming languages,
each with a different lens on computation. You are welcome to choose any programming language
which can accept text input piped to `stdin` and returning an output on `stdout`, the two standard streams
in a UNIX shell, as this is how we will be testing your solutions. Don't worry,
99% of programming languages out there offer this feature.
