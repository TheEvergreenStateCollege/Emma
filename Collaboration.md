# Collaboration Guidelines

This is a community-maintained repository to help our learning organization, Upper Division Computer Science students
at Evergreen, practice and engage with data structures & algorithms, purpose-driven web apps, and software
construction during the 2023-2024 school year.

Your discussion and feedback is not just welcome, but a vital part of our co-learning process.
Our program throughout these three quarters is an experiment where everyone, teaching staff and students, are trying new
ideas and practices, trying to make sense of them, sharing with each other, and applying them.

Here are ways to engage and modify this repository:
* Open an [Issue](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/issues). Here is a place to report bugs, raise questions,
or start conversations. Often, this is a starting place to gather comments from classmates and staff before starting work on a
pull request.
* Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/pulls). Here is a place to submit changes as small as
fixing a typo in the documentation to submitting a correction to homework code or adding your final project.
