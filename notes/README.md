# Upper Division Computer Science Notes

Top-level notes for building documentation.

This is an [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) book,
using a Python script to build a static HTML site from Markdown.

To build it, you'll need to install the
Python package (we recommend putting it into a virtual envionment).

```
git clone git@github.com:TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs.git 
cd notes
pip3 install mkdocs-material
mkdocs build -d ../docs
```

The static site is now generated in the `docs` subdirectory of your local repo.
You can add, commit, and push to publish it to our public website.
